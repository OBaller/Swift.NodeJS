# Swift.NodeJS
Most of us use rest api connection with backend and this way goes single way. I mean, this connection communicates one-way direction. so I wanna talk about this article about how we can connect with the backend. In this article we use nodejs as backend, cause node js is simple to use. We will make a reel world application in this article, make communicate swift and node js socket-io. Our app connect local socket server and listen to it on the fetched-currency-list channel. If get any response on the channel reloads the list again. Every minute app keeps trying to fetch for new list from the server. The server listens to the app on get-new-currency-list If get any requests, return a new list to the app.
